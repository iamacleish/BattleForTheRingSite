    <meta property="og:description" content="The primary goal of Battle for the
    Ring is to provide an intense and excellent fighting and social experience.
    Expect to a full-contact game. Unlike many other LARPs or boffer games,
    Battle for the Ring offers a heavy-impact, full contact game in which shield
    bashing, shield kicking, grappling (some restrictions apply), charging, and
    hard, fast-paced swinging is not only allowed, but encouraged!" />

          Drunkenly fight your way through a bar using a control scheme that
          combines the puzzle style of Puzzles and Dragons, with the erratic
          movement and hilarity of Twitch Plays Pokemon. The game starts with
          the player punching a biker in the face which starts a bar brawl. The
          player solves 1 round of the puzzle, doing those actions in the order
          that the puzzle was cleared. The other people in the bar respond, and
          then its the players turn again. This continues until the player is
          knocked out.

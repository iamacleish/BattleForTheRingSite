      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        The primary goal of Battle for the Ring is to provide an intense and
        excellent fighting and social experience to our experienced and
        returning fighters. At the same time, we hope to use Battle for the
        Ring to introduce new fighters who have never been to a national event,
        as well as cross-sport fighters who are interested in our method of
        play, to the national Belegarth community. We are dedicated to creating
        an enjoyable and educational experience for new fighters, fostering
        unity and good relations across sports, and ultimately creating a
        friendly, mutually supportive community through which the sport of
        Medieval Combat can grow in strength, popularity, and fame.

          Ian has been designing and playing games for most of his life.
          He has experience in level design, camera controllers including
          virtual reality, 3D modeling, gameplay mechanics and more.
          In addition to multiple simulations such as a virtual reality
          bike experience, Ian has worked on several games. These include
          Suddenly Words!, and Bar Crawl: A Night to Forget, both of which
          are available on app stores. Currently, Ian is working on a visual
          novel and card game called Boffer Quest.

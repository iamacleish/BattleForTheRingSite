      <h2>About</h2>
      <p>
        The primary goal of Battle for the Ring is to provide an intense and
        excellent fighting and social experience to our experienced and
        returning fighters. At the same time, we hope to use Battle for the
        Ring to introduce new fighters who have never been to a national event,
        as well as cross-sport fighters who are interested in our method of
        play, to the national Belegarth community. We are dedicated to creating
        an enjoyable and educational experience for new fighters, fostering
        unity and good relations across sports, and ultimately creating a
        friendly, mutually supportive community through which the sport of
        Medieval Combat can grow in strength, popularity, and fame.

        <h4>Sir Anastasia</h4>
          <p>
          Anastasia Nagel founded BftR as a day event at UC Irvine with Brian
          Marion in 2009 and the event is basically a continuation of Wedageddon,
          their medieval fighting and camping wedding event. Ana is effectively
          the CEO of BftR and is relatively knowledgeable about most things
          happening at the event or at least all of the objects involved with it.
          </p>
          <p>
          Ana mostly spends her free time collecting "impressive" titles as a
          hobby, among her favorites in the collection are: Sir Anastasia of
          Chamonix, Knight of the Western Flame, Empress of the Anduril Empire,
          and current President of Belegarth Medieval Combat Society.

        <h4>Darth CheeseHeart</h4>
        <p>
          Darth Cheeseheart-Sith Lord in the Medieval world of Belegarth, and a
          man of many titles. Darth Cheeseheart, also a knight, hails from the
          realm of Stronghold of the Anduril Empire. He is the leader of the
          Sith Empire, a group of black-and-silver-clad warriors, artisans, and
          servants of the community. Cheeseheart has been with Battle for the
          Ring since its inception as a day event at the University of
          California, Irvine, and has served as the BftR's Fighting Coordinator
          and an Event Coordinator since the third installment. He is
          responsible for creating and executing the "theme" of the event each
          year through pre-event publicity, back-story creation, and
          thematically-appropriate scenario battles. He is also the founder of
          the Bel Bowl, BftR's 10-Man Aztec Football tournament. Darth
          Cheeseheart's one goal is to create a truly unique fighting
          experience, for Belegrim old and new, each and every year of the event.

        <h4>Sir Torix</h4>
        <p>
          Sir Torix has been a part of BftR event staff since BftR IV, and has
          been serving the event for longer. He has held many positions including
          Volunteer Coordinator, Assistant Event coordinator, and is currently BftR's
          Web Admin.

          In addition to helping run BftR, Torix is also a realm leader
          and founder of Saracor in Northern California. He has helped to create
          (and continues to improve) open dialogue in Belegarth and other foam
          fighting sports about public safety in both combat and non-combat
          related matters.

          Most recently, Torix helped publish the results and
          writeup of a public health and safety survey that was run
          in foam fighting sports, and helped improve and pass rules updates for
          usage of crossbows in Belegarth.

          Torix also runs Phoenix Rising, a camping event held in late spring in
          Central California.
